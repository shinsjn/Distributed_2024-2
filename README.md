# Distributed_2024-2
jupyter code for 'distribute deep learning' class _project_

For the virtual environment, please refer to the yml file.

1. Comparison of the time taken for training with one existing GPU and the time taken for distributed learning with two GPUs of the same specifications.

2. Compare the differences in inference time and accuracy with the existing one by applying one of the EM model methods.

3. Comparison of torch.compile inference time, which is slightly different from the EM covered in class, but can make a difference in inference time.
